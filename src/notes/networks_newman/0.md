notes:
 - cue: "Key question"
   note: "most fundamental questionwe can ask about networks is this: ifwe
know the shape of a network, what can we learn about the nature and function
of the system it describes? In other words, how are the structural features
of a network related to the practical issues we care about?"
   page: "9"
 - cue: "Metrics"
   note: "Centrality measures - how important a node is in a network. Deg(V) is a centrality measure. Directed graphs have in-degree and out degree."
   page: "9"
 - cue: "Hubs - effects"
   note: "Hubs are vertices with unusually high degree, analsys shows they effect network resilience and transport phenomena."
   page: "9"
 -  cue: "basic internet structure"
    note: "Network backbone providers (NBPs) -> ISP -> Users, BGP negotiation protocol, and traceroute used to analyze structure of the internet."
    page: "16"
 -  cue: "traceroute - router level"
    note: "studies on the internets structure ignore end users, focus on internal routers. Degree distribution follows the power law"
    page: "19"
 -  cue: "granularity to see structure"
    note: "subnets, domains, and autonomous systems. Subnet class C where last octet is variable. Class B last two octets variable, Class A three octets..."
    page: "21"
 -  cue: "Autonmouse systems definition"
    note: "An autonomous system (or AS) is a collection of routers, computers, or other
devices, usually under single administrative control, within which data routing
is handled independently of the wider Internet. Mostly coincide with domain-level, BGP routing tables only route between ASs"

 - cue: "calc geometric length also really interesting pipeline map on 30"
   note: "An early example of a mathematical result
in this area is the formula for estimating the total geometric length of all edges
in such a network by observing the number of times they intersect a regular
array of straight lines [345]. This formula, whose derivation is related to the
well-known “Buffon’s needle” experiment for determining the value of pi, is
most often applied to root systems, but there is no reason it could not also be
useful in the study of river networks or, with suitable modification, any other
type of geographic network."

Chapter 1 and 2 - The normal introductory information, what fields this can 
apply to, structure of the book, and discussed the four categories of networks the book uses as examples. Chapter 2 discusserd technological networks, internet/telephony.
