notes:
 - cue: "Kinds of parallelism"
   note: "multiple data items vs multiple operations. Flynn categorizations looks at streams of data and instructions, leaving  control flow alone... one can form four categories. Single or multiple instruction streams or single or multiple data streams. Ex: SISD (Von Neuman), MIMD (modern multiprocessors), SIMD (Vector computers), and MISD (maybe research but typically not useful)"
   page: "2"
 - cue: "interconnection network"
   note: "usually denoted as a switch. Can be a serial bus or N^2 fully connected network. Concurrency of the system is directly related to concurrency of this network"
   page: "11"
 - cue: "conditions for parallelism"
   note: "functional parallelism - computational units syncrhonize in specific ways or times that limit complexity... vectorization good for dense matrixes, sparse or irregularly patterned data is better suited to MIMD or possibly SISD if cache benefits cant be realized."

Introduces the basic categories and ideas, what archicture variations there concerning memory and inteconnnections, natural progression from Von Neumann archiecture to parallel systems.
